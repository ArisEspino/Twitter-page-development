Sign Up & Login Page - X (Formerly Twitter)

This web page, built with Flutter and programmed in Dart, replicates the basic sign-up and login process of X (formerly Twitter). Users can create an account by entering their name, email, and password. It also includes a login screen for accessing the platform with registered credentials.

The design is modern, responsive, and minimalist, ensuring a smooth experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
